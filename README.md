# personal-website
This is a personal portfolio website built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The website showcases my projects, skills, and experiences, and serves as an online presence for potential employers or collaborators.
It was created as a learning project to improve my front-end development skills and better understand how to build responsive, user-friendly websites. This project demonstrates the use of modern web technologies and design practices.
